# Simple Assembly Language Calculator
This project is a Simple Calculator implemented in 8086 Assembly Language for the CO&AL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language) course. It demonstrates the practical application of low-level programming concepts and interaction with system interrupts to perform arithmetic operations.

The calculator offers the following features:

1. Addition: Adds two single-digit numbers.
2. Subtraction: Subtracts one single-digit number from another.
3. Multiplication: Multiplies two single-digit numbers.
4. Division: Divides one single-digit number by another and handles division by zero errors.
5. Exponentiation: Computes the power of a base number raised to a given exponent.
6. Factorial: Calculates the factorial of a single-digit number.
7. Exit Option: Allows the user to terminate the program gracefully.

The program includes robust input handling, clear error messages for invalid inputs, and a user-friendly menu for navigation. All operations are designed to work with single-digit numbers (0â€“9), and results are displayed in ASCII format.

Features Highlight:

Interactive Menu: Displays a well-structured menu with clear instructions for the user.

Error Handling: Ensures invalid inputs and edge cases, such as division by zero, are managed effectively.

Factorial and Exponentiation: Implements loops to demonstrate iterative calculations in assembly.

Assembly Fundamentals: Showcases the use of system interrupts (INT 21H), register operations, and ASCII-to-binary conversions.


This project reflects a hands-on understanding of assembly language and serves as an excellent resource for students learning low-level programming and 8086 architecture.
